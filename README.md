## Why?
Using XML tags can significantly enhance the output quality of language models (LLMs). By providing a structured format, XML tags help the model understand the context and relationships between different parts of the text. This leads to more accurate and relevant responses. 

For more information, refer to the [Anthropic Prompt Engineering Guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags) or the [OpenAI Prompt Engineering Guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering/).

With this extension, it's now less tedious to format your prompts with xml.
